Team members present (In-Person):
Joey Zamiski, Manal Asad, and Mai Bridge.

Topics discussed:
We decided on using JavaFX for the project. Implementing particular user stories for the two week sprint 
were also talked about. Creating a basic UI and being able to upload data from files were some user stories 
moved from the product backlog to the sprint backlog. The use of a SQL database in the backend was also proposed.
The expected format of input data is yet to be determined.
